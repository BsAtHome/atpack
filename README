Atmel Pack parser interpreter and visualizer
============================================
AtPack will show the contents of the Atmel (Microchip) AtPack XML files, which
describe all the MCUs from their product-range. All calculation is done
client-side using some crude jQuery magic.

Atmel Packs can be download from: http://packs.download.atmel.com/


Features
========
- Selectable AtPack (device list)
- Select a device
- Fuse calculator
- Lockbit calculator
- Show various properties:
	* Documentation (links to datasheet and product page)
	* Variants (package, temperature range, voltage range, ...)
	* Programmer interface
	* Signatures
	* Memory layout
	* Modules
	* Fuses
	* Lockbits
	* Package outlines and pin-assignments

PLEASE NOTE: Only stuff in the device description XML file are shown (files
atdf/*.atdf). Do not complain about the lack of information. This program can
only show what it is fed with. If you need more information then you have the
options a) to read the datasheet, b) complain to Atmel/Microchip or c) fix the
files yourself ;-).


Installation and use
====================
0 - It is assumed you know how to download from github
1 - Get the source-code and put it somewhere on your computer
2 - Point your browser to:
	file:///<your_install_dir>/atpack.html
3 - Have fun.

If you want more/other/newer atpacks, then:
a - goto http://packs.download.atmel.com/
b - get the pack you want
c - make a directory <your_install_dir>/<atpack_name_you_downloaded>
d - unzip the pack into the created directory
e - add a line in file atpackbase.js pointing to the newly extracted pack's
    pdsc file
f - reload you browser window

All AtPacks are loaded when you load the page. The device descriptions are
loaded when you select the device. That means, if you have really many AtPacks
in the list, it may take a while and eat memory in your browser. Caveat Emptor.

The code has been tested with the packs:
